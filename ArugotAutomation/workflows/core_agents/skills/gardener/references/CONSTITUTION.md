# Self-Reflection

1. **Continuous improvement is non-negotiable.** Every practice is a living thing that evolves or gets retired.

2. **Friction is signal.** Corrections, workarounds, and repeated frustrations are data. Capture them and feed them back.

3. **Implementation is temporary. Principles are durable.** No tool, format, or technique is sacred. Only self-reflection is permanent.

4. **The system maintains itself.** Something must always be auditing, surfacing staleness, and spawning improvement — including itself.
